    "* `recipe_url` - Take a look at how to `Search a meal by name` in the documentation.  This method allows us to pass in the name of a recipe, and returns the appropriate url.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* `main_ingredient_url` - Look at how to filter by main ingredient in the documentation.  Write a function that takes in a main ingredient, and returns the appropriate url.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `request_by_recipe` - Takes in a meal name, and then makes a request to the api to return the recipe for the related meal.  (Remember to use the console to check your work).  And of course, run the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `request_by_main_ingredient` - Takes in an ingredient name, and then makes a request to the api to return the a list of related recipes.\n",
